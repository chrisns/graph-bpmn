# How to contribute to this project

## Did you find a bug?

* Until 1.0.0-RC1 is out I'm not accepting bug reports - sorry, this guide will be revised at that point.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

* Before submitting, please make sure it passes the tests and doesn't lower test coverage.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the gitter channel and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
